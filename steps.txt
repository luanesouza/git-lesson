1. Create a repo on github
2. Create a new app in your machine
3. cd into your app and write on your terminal `git init` (you will probably get a message saying "Reinitialized existing Git repository in <path-name>")
4. git remote add origin <url>
5. On your terminal:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "adds message that are appropriate. Writes on third person and is as descriptive as possible"
    - git push origin master
6. Add your partner as collaborator or the partner clones down the repo
7. Never work on the master branch. That way, you cannot compromise by mistake the functionality of the code that other people are using.
8. Commands for both parties:
    - git checkout -b <name-of-branch-according-to-what-you-are-working-on>
    (this branch will have all the changes that are on master)
    - Make a change on the file
    - Add, commit and push to github (check github before and after pushing)

9. Resolving Merge Issues
    - change one of the files
    - push to github (to the pseudo master branch)
    - checkout the pseudo master. pull from the branch where the last changes were made
    - Solve the issues
    - (When you push the changes, they will not appear on the master right away, you will need to pull from master. Or merge the changes)
    - Master will always be the main branch. If Master is ahead in commits, you will be able to delete it
